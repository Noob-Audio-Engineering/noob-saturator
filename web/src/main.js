/**
 * Noob Saturator entry point. Vite serves this file in development and
 * bundles it into `dist/` for production, where the standalone binary serves
 * it from disk and the plug-in embeds it (`include_dir!` under
 * `--features plugin`).
 *
 * In development the client is told about the offline design manifest
 * (`dev/manifest.js`): if no real server answers within a second the page
 * renders against synthetic parameters and frames, and hands over to the
 * plug-in the moment it connects. Production builds never include it, and
 * the panel marks itself DESIGN MODE while it is in use so that nothing
 * invented can be mistaken for a measurement.
